        The golden sun rises in the east,
        The light shines.
        Dongfeng Wanli, flowers are open,
        The red flag is like a big ocean.
        Great mentor, wise leader,
        Dear Chairman Mao!
        The sun is in the hearts of the revolutionary people,
        The red sun in the heart.
        Long live Chairman Mao! (long live Chairman Mao!)
        Long live Chairman Mao! (Long live the Chairman Mao!)
        Long live long live

        Long live Comrade Chairman Mao.

        Open up the fog and disperse that dark cloud.
        The sky is clear.
        The revolutionary ship rides the wind and waves.
        The future is brilliant.
